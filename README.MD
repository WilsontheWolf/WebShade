# WebShade
Web Shade is a simple tweak to make your websites darker.

## How it works
Web Shade injects a copy of [DarkReader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader) into the page and 
runs it. Its super simple with no configuration. I'll probably not support it much. Since I'm 
distributing dark reader's code I've included the license in DarkReader.LICENSE.
