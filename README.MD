# WebShade
WebShade is a simple tweak to make your websites darker.

## How it works
WebShade injects a copy of [DarkReader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader) into the page and 
runs it. It's super simple with no configuration. I'll probably not support it much. Since I'm 
distributing DarkReader's code, I've included the license in [DarkReader.LICENSE](DarkReader.LICENSE).
